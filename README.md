# deep-learning-challenge

# Overview

The purpose of this challenge was to create an algorithm using machine learning and with this algorithm, we should find the accuracy of the information given to us. After the first attempt, we must make the necessary modifications to the algorithm to achieve a minimum accuracy of 75%.

# Results

  - Data Preprocessing
      - The target variable is the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL'
  - Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
